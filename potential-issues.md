# Potential Production Issues Found in server.js

## 1. ✅ Port Configuration
- **Status**: GOOD
- Server correctly uses `process.env.PORT || 3457`
- Binds to `0.0.0.0` which is required for Railway

## 2. ✅ Error Handling
- **Status**: GOOD
- Graceful shutdown handlers implemented
- Server error handling with process.exit(1)
- Try-catch for missing dotenv in production

## 3. ⚠️ Package.json Start Script
- **Status**: POTENTIAL ISSUE
- package.json has `"start": "node index.js"`
- But the main server code is in server.js
- index.js correctly requires server.js, so this should work

## 4. ✅ CORS Configuration
- **Status**: GOOD
- CORS middleware properly configured
- Applied before routes

## 5. ✅ Debug Logging
- **Status**: GOOD
- Comprehensive startup logging
- Will help diagnose deployment issues

## 6. ⚠️ Timeout Configuration
- **Status**: POTENTIAL ISSUE
- Axios requests have 5-second timeout
- Express server has no request timeout
- Could cause issues with slow YouTube responses

## 7. ✅ Memory Management
- **Status**: GOOD
- Limits responses to 20 videos per channel
- 100ms delay between video processing

## 8. ⚠️ No Rate Limiting
- **Status**: MISSING FEATURE
- No rate limiting middleware
- Could be abused in production
- Recommendation: Add express-rate-limit

## 9. ✅ JSON Parsing
- **Status**: GOOD
- express.json() middleware configured

## 10. ⚠️ No Request Logging
- **Status**: MISSING FEATURE
- No morgan or request logging
- Makes debugging production issues harder
- Recommendation: Add morgan for request logs

## Summary

### Critical Issues
- None found that would cause "Not Found" error

### Minor Issues for Future Improvement
1. Add request timeout handling
2. Add rate limiting
3. Add request logging (morgan)
4. Consider adding health check details (uptime, memory usage)

### Most Likely Cause of "Not Found"
1. Railway deployment not actually running
2. Wrong Railway URL being used
3. Railway build/start process failing
